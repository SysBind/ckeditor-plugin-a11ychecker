<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>New York</strong> (NYC) – often called New York City or the City of New York to distinguish it from the State of New York, of which it is a part – is the most populous city in the United States and the center of the New York metropolitan area, the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United States and one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment. Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world.</p>
<p>Situated on one of the world&#39;s largest natural harbors, New York City consists of five boroughs, each of which is a county of New York State. The five boroughs – Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, the Bronx, and Staten Island – were consolidated into a single city in 1898. With a census-estimated 2014 population of 8,491,079 distributed over a land area of just 305 square miles (790 km2), New York is the most densely populated major city in the United States. As many as 800 languages are spoken in New York, making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world. By 2014 census estimates, the New York City metropolitan region remains by a significant margin the most populous in the United States, as defined by both the Metropolitan Statistical Area (20.1 million residents) and the Combined Statistical Area (23.6 million residents). In 2013, the MSA produced a gross metropolitan product (GMP) of nearly US$1.39 trillion, while in 2012, the CSA generated a GMP of over US$ 1.55 trillion, both ranking first nationally by a wide margin and behind the GDP of only twelve nations and eleven nations, respectively.</p>
<h2 id="boroughs">Boroughs</h2>
<p><img src="img/sample/Lower_Manhattan_viewed_from_Brooklyn.jpg"></p>
<p>1) Manhattan (New York County) is the most densely populated borough and is home to Central Park and most of the city&#39;s skyscrapers.<br>
2) The Bronx (Bronx County) is New York City&#39;s northernmost borough, the location of Yankee Stadium, home of the New York Yankees, and home to the largest cooperatively owned housing complex in the United States, Co-op City.<br>
3) Brooklyn (Kings County), on the western tip of Long Island, is the city&#39;s most populous borough and was an independent city until 1898.<br>
4) Queens (Queens County), on Long Island east of Brooklyn, is geographically the largest borough, the most ethnically diverse county in the United States, as well as the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world.<br>
5) Staten Island (Richmond County) is the most suburban in character of the five boroughs.<br></p>

<p>New York City is the most-populous city in the United States, with an estimated record high of 8,491,079 residents as of 2014, incorporating more immigration into the city than outmigration since the 2010 United States Census. More people live in New York City than in the next two most-populous U.S. cities (Los Angeles and Chicago) combined. This amounts to about 40% of the state of New York&#39;s population and a similar percentage of the metropolitan regional population. In 2006, demographers estimated that New York&#39;s population will reach between 9.2 and 9.5 million by 2030.</p>
<p><img src="img/sample/1_times_square_night_2013.jpg" alt="Times Square is the hub of the Broadway theater district. It also has one of the highest annual attendance rates of any tourist attraction in the world, estimated at 50 million."></p>
<p>Throughout its history, the city has been a major port of entry for immigrants into the United States; more than 12 million European immigrants were received at Ellis Island between 1892 and 1924. The term <span style="font-style: italic;">&quot;melting pot&quot;</span> was first coined to describe densely populated immigrant neighborhoods on the Lower East Side. By 1900, Germans constituted the largest immigrant group, followed by the Irish, Jews, and Italians. In 1940, whites represented 92% of the city&#39;s population.</p>
